1. Write a query to display the ff columns ID (should start
with T + 11 digits of trn_teacher.id with leading zeros like
'T00000088424'), Nickname, Status and Roles (like
Trainer/Assessor/Staff) using table trn_teacher and
trn_teacher_role.

SELECT CONCAT("T", LPAD(trn_teacher.id,11.'0')) as ID, 
       trn_teacher.nickname as Nickname, 
       trn_teacher.status as Status, 
       CASE 
        WHEN trn_teacher_role.role = 1 THEN "Trainer"
        WHEN trn_teacher_role.role = 2 THEN "Assessor"
        WHEN trn_teacher_role.role = 3 THEN "Staff"
       END as Roles
FROM trn_teacher 
INNER JOIN trn_teacher_role ON trn_teacher.id = trn_teacher_role.teacher_id


2. Write a query to display the ff columns ID (from teacher.id),
Nickname, Open (total open slots from trn_teacher_time_table),
Reserved (total reserved slots from trn_teacher_time_table),
Taught (total taught from trn_evaluation) and NoShow (total
no_show from trn_evaluation) using all tables above. Should
show only those who are active (trn_teacher.status = 1 or 2)
and those who have both Trainer 

SELECT trn_teacher.id as ID, 
       trn_teacher.nickname as Nickname,
       COUNT(SELECT * FROM trn_time_table WHERE status = 1) as "Open",
       COUNT(SELECT * FROM trn_time_table WHERE status = 3) as "Reserved",
       COUNT(SELECT * FROM trn_evaluation WHERE result = 1) as "Taught",
       COUNT(SELECT * FROM trn_evaluation WHERE result = 2) as "No Show"
       FROM trn_teacher 
       INNER JOIN trn_teacher_role on trn_teacher.teacher_id = trn_teacher_role.teacher_id
       INNER JOIN trn_time_table on trn_teacher.teacher_id = trn_time_table.teacher_id
       INNER JOIN trn_evaluation on trn_teacher.teacher_id = trn_evaluation.teacher_id
       WHERE (trn_teacher.status = 1 OR trn_teacher.status = 2) AND (trn_teacher_role.role = 1 OR trn_teacher_role.role = 2)
       GROUP BY trn_teacher.teacher_id
